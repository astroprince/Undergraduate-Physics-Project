Undergraduate Research Project in Physics With Prof. Nikolina Ilic \
Project Title: MODIFYING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR IMPROVED TAU NEUTRINO SENSITIVITY IN THE DUNE DETECTOR

This project encompasses a concise historical overview of advancements in neutrino physics and an introduction to neutrino oscillation theory. Next, the specifics of Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) and their proposed application in the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) are explored. Additionally, a gentle introduction to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their relevance in High-Energy Physics (HEP) is offered. Expanding upon this, a specific GNN called NuGraph2 and the modifications made to enhance its performance specifically for tau neutrino event classification is discussed. These enhancements have resulted in improved tau neutrino event detection capabilities within the framework of DUNE.
