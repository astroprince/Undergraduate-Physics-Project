Undergraduate Research Project in Physics With Prof. Nikolina Ilic \
Project Title: MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO DETERMINE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE DUNE DETECTOR TO DETECT TAU NEUTRINOS

This project is going to focus on developing a binary classification neural network for neutrino decay events. This work will contribute to determining the sensitivity of the DUNE detector to detect tau neutrinos.
