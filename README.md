Undergraduate Research Project in Physics With Prof. Nikolina Ilic \
Project Title: MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO DETERMINE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE DUNE DETECTOR TO DETECT TAU NEUTRINOS

This project is going to focus on modifying current neutrino machine learning architectures (such as pynuml and nugraph) to determine the sensitivity of the DUNE detector to detect tau neutrinos.
